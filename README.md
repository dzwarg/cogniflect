## Getting Started

This application was built in the Codeanywhere online IDE, and makes some assumptions about that environment.

Checkout the source from source, and change the working directory to the cogniflect directory.

Run the application in development mode:

```
npm start
```

This will start both a socket server and a web application (which proxies requests to the socket server).

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The application is powered by:

 * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 * [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
 * [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
 * [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
 * [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
 * [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/)
 * [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
 * [Concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently#readme)
 * [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
